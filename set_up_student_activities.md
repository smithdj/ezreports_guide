## SETTING UP STUDENT ACTIVITIES 

In this section:  
- [Add Activity Categories](#activity-categories) 
- [Add Sessions](#activity-sessions)  

***

**Note:** All programs should be added into EZReports either before or within two weeks of program start date.

### DOCUMENTING STUDENT ACTIVITIES AND EVENTS
EZReports requires activity categories to be created to group multiple activities together. Activity Categories for each type of session/class must be created before individual sessions/classes can be added. Categories from previous years may already exist in EZReports. Please use existing categories that are still relevant before creating new ones. Sessions or classes can be added only after the activities have been set up.

***

### Activity Categories
#### Adding Activity Categories for Regular Student Activities
-	Go to “Activities” 🡪 “Regular Activities”.
-	Click “Add Activities” button.
-	Specify the Activity Category name from a predefined list of categories; this is the broader name, e.g., “Academic Enrichment”. 
-	Ensure that the targeted audience and participant fields indicate only students.
-	Enter a two-sentence description of the activity category.
-	Select “yes” or “no” to indicate College and Career Readiness.
-	Select the activity category that best fits the overall activity category.
-	Select at least one detailed activity focus – you can select up to three focus areas to indicate other categories the activity falls under or focuses on (e.g., health and wellness and career exploration).
    -	Enter the percentage of focus in the activities – the sum should equal 100%. 
-	Click “Save & Close”.

### Activity Sessions
#### Adding Sessions for Regular Student Activities after you’ve set up your activity categories:
Go to “Activities” 🡪 “Regular Activities”.
-	Click the activity category for which you want to add a session. Click on the “Add Session” link. 
-	Name the Activity Session with a descriptive title, including if the activity is virtual or asynchronous. For example, if you are adding an activity in the Academic Enrichment category, the Session Name could be “Grade 3 Math Tutoring Ms. Johnson”. 
    -	Note: The Session Names are what L&G sees when they evaluate program data and produce the weekly update.
-	Enter the Start Date and End Date. These are estimates and can be modified later.
-	Select the Instruction Delivery Method:
    -	In-Person (Live at site) – Regular in-person classroom when students are attending the program at the site.
    -	Virtual (Synchronous at home) – Real-time/live virtual instruction by instructors when students are at home.
    -	Virtual (Asynchronous at home) – Instructions via online tools without real-time interaction, e.g., assignments and project-based learning.
    -	Non-Virtual (At home) – Instruction material/packet sent home to be completed independently by student.
-	Select the day(s) the activity is offered and the time(s):
    -	If the activity is offered at different times across multiple days, check the “different time for different days” box and it will prompt you to customize the time for each day you selected.
-	Select the time frame of the session (e.g., during lunch, after school, before school). Please select an accurate time frame aligned with the actual time of the session.
-	Select the grade levels served in the session.
-	Select staffing level ratios (e.g., 1:>20, 1:2-7).
-	Click on ‘Save & Continue’ to move to the ‘Staff & Provider’ tab.
-	Click on ‘Add Staff / Volunteer’ and ‘Add Provider’ to add a Staff / Volunteer and Provider, respectively.
    -	In the pop-up displayed for each, specify the ‘Start Date’ and select the desired Staff / Volunteer or Provider and click ‘Save & Close’ to link them to the session. (Please note that the start date of the session cannot precede the start date of the employee, or you’ll get an error.)
-	Click “Close”.
-	Note: If there are staff changes later in the year, new staff can be added and dropped, indicating the start and end dates for each staff member.
