## ADDING PARTICIPANTS 

In this section:  
- [Add Students](#students)  
- [Add Adults](#adults)  
- [Add Staff](#staff)

***

**NOTE:** All participants should be added in EZReports either before or within two weeks of program start date.

### Students
#### Youth Participant Information (students)
**Required Fields:** last name, first name, DOB, Gender, Address, Primary Language, Lunch Status, Race/Ethnicity, Registration Date, School, Grade, and District Student ID (OSIS).

#### Before adding students, check if students have participant profiles already in EZReports**
-	If a student is already in the database, **DO NOT REENTER THE STUDENT’S NAME**. This is important to prevent duplicate entries. Instead, edit the existing entry, especially if it is incorrect or has missing fields that are required. 
-	To limit data entry errors, search for students by their name or grade level. The easiest way to search for a name is to enter the first two letters of the first or last name and click “find”, which will bring up a list of all students with first or last names starting with those letters. This ensures that if there was a data entry mistake, such as misspelling the name or swapping the first and last name, the student will be found in the system. 

#### Adding Students Individually
-	Go to `Registration` &rightarrow; `Students`
-	In the `Active` tab, click on the `Add Student` button.
-	EZReports will ask if a student has a sibling in the system. Click `CANCEL` to bypass this feature and reach the `Add Registration` page.
-	Enter required fields for the student. 
-	Click `Save and Close`.
-	__*Always search for a student’s name before adding them to the database. See note below.*__

> **Please Note:**
> -	If using Bulk Upload to register multiple students, you can filter by school, grade, and student information. Once you’ve picked your criteria, click register and ensure you specify the registration date for the students selected. 
> -	In the Registration page, you can search students who are listed as Active, Dropped or Deleted.

#### Adding Adult Participant Information (parents & community members)
-	Required Fields: first name, last name, and registration date.
-	Go to `Registration` &rightarrow; `Adults`.
-	In the `Active` tab, click on the `Add Adult` button.
-	EZReports will ask if the adult has a child in the system. If the adult is not a parent or guardian of a student, click `CANCEL` to bypass this feature and reach the `Add Registration` page.
